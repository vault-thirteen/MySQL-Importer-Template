# MySQL Importer Template

A template for an application importing data into MySQL database.

This application is not automated. The configuration is hard-coded.  
That is why, this is not a tool, but a template for a tool instead.  

## Why ?

The built-in tools for MySQL do not work properly.

**Example #1.**  
`MySQL Workbench` shows random numbers of rows in a table when the table is 
completely static. 

**Example #2.**  
`MySQL Shell` hangs indefinetely during script execution, while this tiny tool 
written in Go language executes the script in several seconds. 

It looks like `Oracle` company is doing real shit.   
We are not fools.  
Be aware.
